***General Introduction***
This dataset contains data collected during crack growth experiments at Delft University of Technology, as part of Liaojun Yao's PhD Thesis project (December 2015): doi:10.4233/uuid:66e210e1-c884-45d6-b9d4-711907680452
It is being made public both to act as supplementary data for publications and the PhD thesis of Liaojun Yao and in order for other researchers to use this data in their own work.
The data in this data set was collected in the Structures and Materials Laboratory of the Delft University of Technology - Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, between October 2012 and December 2015.
This research project was made possible by a grant from the China Scholarship Council (CSC).

***Purpose of the test campaign***
The purpose of these experiments was to investigate delamination growth in CFRP composites. The Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) specimens were subjected to a variety of load cases, as detailed in "Text matrix.doc"

***Test equipment***
All tests were performed on a 10 kN MTS fatigue test machine. The crack length was measured by means of a camera system.
The applied force and displacement were measured by the fatigue test machine, and also sent as inputs to the camera, in order to facilitate synchronisation of the data.
***Description of the data in this data set***
The data included in this data set has been organised per specimen. The files follow the nomenclature system: Sp_X_Data_analysis_Y with
X = the specimen number 1 to 56
Y = indicating the number of runs with the same specimen.
